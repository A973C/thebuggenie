----Setting up SVN integration----
----------------------------------

To set up SVN integration, follow these three steps:

    * Add post-commit hook to SVN repository
      In the module directory, there is a post-commit.sh script that needs to be triggered upon an SVN commit. If you don't use any other commit-hooks, this script can replace the default post-commit script. If you already have a working post-commit.sh script, copy the contents of that file into your existing post-commit.sh script.
      Remember to remove the post-commit.sh from the module directory, or make it inaccessible from the web
      
      If you don't know how to set this up, please consult the SVN manual.

    * Edit post-commit script
      Make sure you edit the script so the correct path is used. If you are going to use the web-update, make sure the settings in the file matches the settings on the SVN integration configuration page.

    * Set up ViewVC
      ViewVC is a web interface for browsing repositories. To use this, please set it up according to the instructions on the ViewVC website.

      When ViewVC is set up, make sure you set up the URLs to ViewVC in the SVN integration configuration panel. 


When you have followed the three steps above, you should be able to use the SVN integration module.

----SVN integration usage----
-----------------------------

The SVN integration module integrates in several places:

    * SVN commits
      When you are committing, the SVN integration will look through the commit comment and update any issues referenced.

      The module will look for the following words:
      fix, fixes, fixed, fixing, applies to, close, closes, references, ref, addresses, re, see, according to, followed by a # and an issue number.
      (You can reference as many issues as you want in a commit comment.)

      Commit comment example: Fixing #B2-12, #B2-11 and #B2-10. Also see #B2-14.
      This comment will update all four issues with the information from the commit, and post comments on all issues.

      The SVN integration module does not close issues automatically.

    * SVN commit log on issues
      When viewing issues, all SVN commits will be visible at the bottom of the summary, with quick links to the log, diff and file directly (if ViewVC is set up).

    * "View code"
      The product overview page will have a "view code" link in the top right corner.
